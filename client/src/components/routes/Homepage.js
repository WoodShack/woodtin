                    <b>Tinson</b> allows you to create a list of homebrew or backup'ed games (from your collection) and download them directly on your switch. Without having to use cable or something else.

                    The only one requirements is to have Tinfoil installed on your Nintendo Switch and add to <i>File browser</i> section the URL generated by Tinson.

                    I've called it a registration but it's nothing more than a "choose your file name". After you have set a username and a password I'll create a JSON file with Node.
                    Now everytime you'll login with your previous credentials I'll grab the saved file.
